Get my email folders, create a new folder called 'Urgent', move any unread emails with 'ASAP' in the subject to this folder, and create a Jira task to review these emails.
        

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
[2025-03-12T12:54:30.726043], Orchestrator (thought):

Initial plan:

We are working to address the following user request:


        Get my email folders, create a new folder called 'Urgent', move any unread emails with 'ASAP' in the subject to this folder, and create a Jira task to review these emails.
        


To answer this request we have assembled the following team:

MailAgent: An agent that can interact with Outlook emails. The agent is already authenticated to the Outlook account.
JiraAgent: An agent that can interact with Jira. The agent is already authenticated to the Jira account.
ChatGPT: A general-purpose AI assistant to be consulted only when specialized agents cannot handle a specific task or when additional analysis is required.
SlackAgent: An agent that can interact with Slack. The agent is already authenticated to the Slack account.
OutlookCalendarAgent: An agent that can interact with Outlook calendar. The agent is already authenticated to the Outlook calendar account.



Here is an initial fact sheet to consider:

1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS
   - The request involves managing email folders.
   - A new folder named 'Urgent' needs to be created.
   - Unread emails with 'ASAP' in the subject should be moved to the 'Urgent' folder.
   - A Jira task should be created to review these emails.

2. FACTS TO LOOK UP
   - Specific instructions or guidelines on how to create a folder and move emails in the user's email service provider.
   - Steps to create a task in Jira, if the user is unfamiliar with the process.

3. FACTS TO DERIVE
   - The criteria for identifying unread emails, which is based on the subject containing 'ASAP'.
   - The process to automate or manually perform the task of moving emails and creating a Jira task, if needed.

4. EDUCATED GUESSES
   - The user is likely using a common email service like Outlook, Gmail, or similar, and Jira as a project management tool.
   - The user is seeking an efficient way to manage urgent communications and track them through Jira.


Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:

- MailAgent:
  - Retrieve the list of email folders.
  - Create a new folder named 'Urgent'.
  - Search for unread emails with 'ASAP' in the subject line.
  - Move these identified emails to the 'Urgent' folder.

- JiraAgent:
  - Once the emails are moved, create a new Jira task to review the emails in the 'Urgent' folder.
  - Include relevant details in the task description, such as the number of emails moved and any specific actions required.

- ChatGPT (if needed):
  - Provide additional guidance or troubleshooting if the email and Jira processes encounter issues or require clarifications.

- SlackAgent (if needed):
  - Notify the user via Slack about the completion of the task and the creation of the Jira task, if such notifications are part of the user's preferred workflow.

- OutlookCalendarAgent:
  - This agent is not necessary for the current task unless scheduling follow-up meetings is required, but can be engaged if the user requests further calendar-related management.
