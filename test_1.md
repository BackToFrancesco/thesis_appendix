Retrieve unread emails, categorize each email from a priority of 1 to 5 based on the following level of priority:
- 1: No action required, purely for awareness (e.g., announcements, automated emails).
- 2: No immediate action needed, just for reference (e.g., newsletters, non-urgent requests).
- 3: Important but can wait (e.g., follow-ups, general work updates).
- 4: Requires action soon but not immediate (e.g., scheduled meetings, important tasks).
- 5: Needs urgent response or action (e.g., critical issues, deadlines).

Finally, send in the Slack channel social only the summary of all the emails with priority >=3.

Initial plan:

We are working to address the following user request:


        Retrieve unread emails, categorize each email from a priority of 1 to 5 based on the following level of priority:
        - 1: No action required, purely for awareness (e.g., announcements, automated emails).
        - 2: No immediate action needed, just for reference (e.g., newsletters, non-urgent requests).
        - 3: Important but can wait (e.g., follow-ups, general work updates).
        - 4: Requires action soon but not immediate (e.g., scheduled meetings, important tasks).
        - 5: Needs urgent response or action (e.g., critical issues, deadlines).
        
        Finally, send in the Slack channel #social only the summary of all the emails with priority >=3.
        


To answer this request we have assembled the following team:

MailAgent: An agent that can interact with Outlook emails. The agent is already authenticated to the Outlook account.
SlackAgent: An agent that can interact with Slack. The agent is already authenticated to the Slack account.
ChatGPT: A general-purpose AI assistant to be consulted only when specialized agents cannot handle a specific task or when additional analysis is required.
JiraAgent: An agent that can interact with Jira. The agent is already authenticated to the Jira account.
OutlookCalendarAgent: An agent that can interact with Outlook calendar. The agent is already authenticated to the Outlook calendar account.



Here is an initial fact sheet to consider:

1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS
   - Priority levels are specified from 1 to 5, with definitions for each level based on urgency and required action.
   - Unread emails need to be retrieved.
   - Emails with priority levels of 3, 4, or 5 need to have their summaries sent to the Slack channel #social.

2. FACTS TO LOOK UP
   - How to access and retrieve unread emails using the email service provider's API or interface.
   - How to integrate Slack with the email service to send messages to a specific channel.
  
3. FACTS TO DERIVE
   - The categorization of each email into priority levels from 1 to 5 based on its content and header information.
   - The summary information for emails with priority levels of 3, 4, or 5 for inclusion in the Slack message.

4. EDUCATED GUESSES
   - Likely platforms or services being used for emails and Slack integration, such as Gmail API for fetching emails and Slack API or Zapier for automating the sending of messages to the channel #social.


Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:

- **MailAgent**:
  - Retrieve unread emails from the Outlook account.
  - Analyze each email's content to categorize them into priority levels 1 to 5 based on the provided criteria.

- **ChatGPT** (if needed):
  - Assist MailAgent in analyzing email content to determine priority levels if there is any difficulty in interpretation.

- **MailAgent**:
  - Extract summaries of emails with priority levels 3, 4, or 5.

- **SlackAgent**:
  - Send the summaries of the categorized emails with priority levels 3, 4, or 5 to the Slack channel #social.

- **Review Process**:
  - Verify the successful extraction, categorization, and delivery of email summaries through Slack.

Here are the categorizations based on the provided criteria:

   **Priority:** 5 - Needs urgent response or action  
   Reason: The main server being down requires immediate attention.

2. **Email ID:** 2

   Reason: A team lunch invitation is primarily for awareness and optional participation.

3. **Email ID:** 3  
   **Priority:** 4 - Requires action soon but not immediate  
   Reason: Submission of the quarterly report by end of the day suggests importance but not immediate urgency.

4. **Email ID:** 4  
   **Priority:** 3 - Important but can wait  
   Reason: The kickoff meeting next week can be noted as significant but can wait until the specified date.

5. **Email ID:** 5  
   **Priority:** 2 - No immediate action needed, just for reference  
   Reason: Inquiry about office supplies order does not demand immediate response.
