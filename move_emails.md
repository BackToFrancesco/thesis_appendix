Move the unread Outlook emails to a new created folder called 'unread email'
```

Initial plan:

We are working to address the following user request:
```
Move the unread Outlook emails to a new created folder called 'unread email'
```

To answer this request we have assembled the following team:

OutlookAgent: An agent that can interact with Outlook emails.



Here is an initial fact sheet to consider:

1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS
   - The request is to move unread Outlook emails.
   - A new folder needs to be created called 'unread email'.

2. FACTS TO LOOK UP
   - How to create a new folder in Outlook.
   - How to identify unread emails in Outlook.
   - Steps to move emails into a different folder in Outlook.

3. FACTS TO DERIVE
   - Whether the user has permission to create folders and move emails in their Outlook account. 

4. EDUCATED GUESSES
   - The user is referring to Microsoft Outlook, given its popularity as an email client.
   - The instructions might slightly vary depending on the version of Outlook (e.g., Outlook 365, Outlook 2019).
   - The solution could involve using Outlook's rules or a script to automate the process.


Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:

- **Create the 'unread email' Folder:**
  - Use OutlookAgent to access the Outlook account.
  - Create a new folder named 'unread email' using Outlook functions.

- **Identify Unread Emails:**
  - Utilize OutlookAgent to filter and identify all unread emails in the user's inbox.

- **Move Unread Emails to the New Folder:**
  - Instruct OutlookAgent to move all identified unread emails to the newly created 'unread email' folder.

- **Verify the Action:**
  - Confirm that all unread emails have been successfully moved to the 'unread email' folder.
  - Ensure no unread emails remain in the original inbox unless specified otherwise by the user.

- **Feedback to User:**
  - Notify the user that the task is complete and verify the setup as per their request.
