```
Retrieve unread emails, categorize each email from a priority of 1 to 5,
and then send me in the Slack channel #social only the summary of all
the emails with priority >= 3
```

[2025-01-03T10:20:54.330556], Orchestrator (thought) 🧠:

Initial plan:

We are working to address the following user request:

```
Retrieve unread emails, categorize each email from a priority of 1 to 5,
and then send me in the Slack channel #social only the summary of all
the emails with priority >= 3
```
To answer this request we have assembled the following team:

MailAgent: An agent that can interact with Outlook emails.
SlackAgent: An agent that can interact with Slack.
ChatGPT: An agent that emulates ChatGPT's capabilities for various tasks.

Here is an initial fact sheet to consider:

1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS  
   - The request is to retrieve unread emails.  
   - Emails need to be categorized from a priority of 1 to 5.  
   - Only summaries of emails with priority >= 3 should be sent to the Slack channel #social.  

2. FACTS TO LOOK UP  
   - The specific definitions or criteria used to categorize the emails from priority 1 to 5 (this may be specific to the organization).  
   - The mechanism or API for sending messages to the Slack channel #social (how to correctly format and send messages via the designated application).  

3. FACTS TO DERIVE  
   - The total number of unread emails retrieved and their respective categories.  
   - The summaries of the emails that fall under the priority level of 3 or higher after categorization.  

4. EDUCATED GUESSES  
   - Higher-priority emails (4 or 5) are likely to be time-sensitive or critical in nature, whereas lower-priority emails may not require immediate attention.  
   - The user probably uses a standardized system for categorizing emails, which may be consistent across similar platforms (e.g., importance, urgency, action required).  


Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:

- **MailAgent**:  
  - Retrieve unread emails from the user's Outlook account.  
  - Categorize each email based on a predefined system of priority levels (1 to 5).  

- **ChatGPT**:  
  - Analyze the categorized emails to extract summaries for those with a priority level of 3 or higher.  

- **SlackAgent**:  
  - Send the summaries of the prioritized emails (priority level >= 3) to the Slack channel #social.
