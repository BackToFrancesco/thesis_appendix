Initial plan:

We are working to address the following user request:
```
Move the unread Outlook emails to a new created folder called 'unread email'
```

To answer this request we have assembled the following team:

OutlookAgent: An agent that can interact with Outlook emails.



Here is an initial fact sheet to consider:

1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS
   - The request involves moving unread emails in Outlook.
   - A new folder needs to be created called 'unread email'.

2. FACTS TO LOOK UP
   - How to create a new folder in Outlook.
   - How to filter for unread emails in Outlook.
   - How to move emails to a specific folder in Outlook.

3. FACTS TO DERIVE
   - The types of interfaces (e.g., web, desktop, mobile) where the task can be performed, which may affect the steps needed.

4. EDUCATED GUESSES
   - The user is likely using a version of Outlook that includes the ability to create folders and move emails, such as Outlook 2016, Outlook 2019, or Office 365.
   - The task might be performed using Outlook's web app or desktop version, suggesting a need for understanding the specific interface being used.


Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:

- Assign the task to OutlookAgent to handle the operations within Outlook.

- **Step 1**: Have OutlookAgent create a new folder in Outlook named 'unread email'.

- **Step 2**: Instruct OutlookAgent to filter the inbox for unread emails.

- **Step 3**: Direct OutlookAgent to move all filtered unread emails to the newly created 'unread email' folder.

- **Step 4**: Verify that all unread emails have been successfully moved to the new folder.
