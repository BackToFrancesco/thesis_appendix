        Get my email folders, create a new folder called 'Urgent', move any unread emails with 'ASAP' in the subject to this folder, and create a Jira task to review these emails.

Initial plan:

We are working to address the following user request:


        Get my email folders, create a new folder called 'Urgent', move any unread emails with 'ASAP' in the subject to this folder, and create a Jira task to review these emails.
        


To answer this request we have assembled the following team:

MailAgent: An agent that can interact with Outlook emails.
JiraAgent: An agent that can interact with Jira.
ChatGPT: A general-purpose AI assistant to be consulted only when specialized agents cannot handle a specific task or when additional analysis is required.
SlackAgent: An agent that can interact with Slack.
OutlookCalendarAgent: An agent that can interact with Outlook calendar.



Here is an initial fact sheet to consider:

```json
{
  "GIVEN_OR_VERIFIED_FACTS": [
    "Create a new email folder named 'Urgent'",
    "Move unread emails with 'ASAP' in the subject to the 'Urgent' folder",
    "Create a Jira task to review these emails"
  ],
  "FACTS_TO_LOOK_UP": [
    "Finding how to access and manipulate email folders for the user's specific email provider, which could be found in their email client documentation or API",
    "Instructions on creating tasks in Jira, found in Jira's official documentation"
  ],
  "FACTS_TO_DERIVE": [
    "The specific steps required to sort emails based on subject keywords",
    "Understanding user-specific email and Jira system configurations"
  ],
  "EDUCATED_GUESSES": [
    "Assume the user has the necessary permissions to create email folders and Jira tasks",
    "User's email account and Jira account are integrated with APIs for automation"
  ]
}
```


Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:
